## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    Setup is to initialize once, loop is to constantly run commands.

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    It will repeat infinitely.

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    It needs to be converted to machine code.

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

    It cannot work at that frequency. I lowered the frequency to 12MHz and the logic analyzer was able to record data.

5. Why do you need to connect the logic analyzer ground to the ESP32 ground?

    So it can be part of the same circuit, and therefore the same relative 0V that is the ESP32 ground.

6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?

    Synchronous requires a clock to be set on both side and a constant stream of data. Asynchronous can be sent in different waves or with different timing.
